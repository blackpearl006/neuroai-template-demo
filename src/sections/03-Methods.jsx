            <p>
              The Playground exposes four thresholding levels (top 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%). The top-20% threshold is most permissive — maximising sensitivity to broadly relevant regions. Top-5% identifies only the strongest, most consistent contributors.

            <p>
              A binomial test (one-tailed, FDR-corrected) compares observed ROI counts against the null hypothesis of uniform attribution across ROIs. Significant ROIs are marked with ✓ in the table and rendered in solid colour in the 3D viewer.
